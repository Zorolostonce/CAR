Hardware Components Overview
1. CPU (Central Processing Unit) / Processor
Description: Known as the "brain" of the computer, located on the motherboard.
Structure:
A small ceramic square with a silicon chip inside.
Placed in the motherboard's CPU socket, typically covered by a heat sink.
Performance: Measured in:
MHz (Megahertz): Millions of instructions per second.
GHz (Gigahertz): Billions of instructions per second.
2. RAM (Random Access Memory)
Function: Acts as the computer's short-term memory.
Characteristics:
Data is stored temporarily and lost when the computer powers off.
Measured in MB (Megabytes) or GB (Gigabytes).
3. Power Supply Unit (SMPS)
Role: Converts AC power from the wall outlet to DC power usable by the computer.
Purpose: Supplies power to the motherboard and other components via cables.
4. Motherboard
Definition: The main circuit board of the computer.
Function: Connects all hardware components directly or indirectly.
5. NIC (Network Interface Card)
Purpose: Enables the computer to connect to networks and access the Internet.
Types:
Wired (via Ethernet cable).
Wireless (Wi-Fi).
6. Expansion Cards (PCI Cards)
Description: Peripheral Component Interconnect cards that expand a computerâ€™s capabilities.
Example: Some add-ons include enhanced video, sound, or network functionalities.
7. Processor Cooling Fan
Role: Sits on top of the processor.
Function: Dissipates heat generated by the CPU to prevent overheating.
8. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Purpose: Long-term storage for software, documents, and files.
Characteristics:
Data persists even when the system is powered off or unplugged.
